# The Code
This code was my solution to the Hackerrank Sherlock and anagrams algorithm problem.  
The code simply finds all the substrings from given string, alphabetically order each substring, then  
Compares the substrings in the list. If there is a match, it will increase the enegram count by 1.  
When the compare loop is done, it returns the enegram count.
