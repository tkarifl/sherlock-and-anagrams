# The Code
This code was my solution to the Hackerrank Sherlock and anagrams algorithm problem.  
The code simply finds all the substrings from given string, alphabetically order each substring, adds them to the  
List, then compares the substrings in the list. If there is a match, it will increase the enegram count by 1.   
When the comparison loop is over, it returns the enegram count.
